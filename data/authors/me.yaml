bio: |
  Hello! This is Yuxuan (Vincent) Zhang (张宇轩). I am currently a postdoctoral researcher in [Prof. Dmitry Abanin](https://phy.princeton.edu/people/dmitry-abanin)’s group that superposes between Princeton and EPFL. My research lies at the interface of quantum information, quantum many-body physics, and artificial intelligence, with a particular focus on quantum algorithms, quantum advantage, and AI-assisted physical science discovery. I'm always open to new collaborations and looking for motivated students, if interested, please feel free to reach out to me!

  I completed my early education in my hometown, Tangshan, and graduated from Tangshan No. 1 High School in 2013. I received my B.S. in physics with Highest Honors from the University of California, Santa Barbara in 2016, and then spent a year at the Institute of High Energy Physics in Beijing, working on collider physics and detector reconstruction. I then obtained my Ph.D. in physics from The University of Texas at Austin, where I was advised by Andrew C. (Drew) Potter and Scott Aaronson. From Fall 2023-2025, I was a CQIQC Fellow at the [Centre for Quantum Information and Quantum Control](https://cqiqc.physics.utoronto.ca/) at the University of Toronto, with a joint appointment at the Vector Institute for Artificial Intelligence, working closely with [Yong-Baek Kim](https://sites.google.com/view/ybkimgroup/yong-baek-kim), [Juan Carrasquilla](https://www.phys.ethz.ch/the-department/people/person-detail.jcarrasquill.html), and [Dvira Segal](https://sites.chem.utoronto.ca/chemistry/dsegal/).

  Outside of research, I enjoy traveling, photography, classical music, and real-time strategy games.

  After all, what have I learned about the quantum world so far? Well, in short:

  > You observed me, and thus we entangled – though I could never be a copy of you.
